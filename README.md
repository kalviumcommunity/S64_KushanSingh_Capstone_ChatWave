# 🌊 ChatWave – Real-Time Chat App (Capstone Project)

## 📌 Project Title  
**ChatWave 🌊 – A Real-Time Chat Application**

## 💡 Project Idea  
**ChatWave** is a full-stack real-time chat application built with a strong focus on backend engineering. It features user authentication, real-time messaging via WebSockets (Socket.io), and a minimal, clean React frontend. Users can log in, see who's online, chat instantly, and optionally share media. The backend is powered by Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and optionally enhanced with Redis caching and file upload support (Cloudinary).

## 🧠 Brief Description  
This project is part of my 30-day capstone journey focused on strengthening backend skills while delivering a production-grade application. While the frontend is minimal for presentation purposes, the backend follows industry practices including JWT-based authentication, real-time communication using Socket.io, RESTful API structuring, and optional CI/CD integration.
